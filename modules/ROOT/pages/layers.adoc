= Use Layers in Anypoint Visualizer
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

When you associate a node with a layer, you create a visual representation of the applications in your network.
Use one of the default layers provided by Anypoint Visualizer, or create a custom layer.

== Add an API, Application, or Proxy to a Layer

Map a node to a layer in the application's properties file, or use the Anypoint Visualizer UI.

=== Set a Layer with Properties
To automate the classification of nodes into layers, configure the property `anypoint.platform.visualizer.layer=<name>` in the application's properties file.

When this property is used, nodes automatically appear in the specified layer. If the layer doesn't exist it is created.

[NOTE]
====
* For applications deployed to standalone Mule runtime engines, layer names set using runtime properties can contain only alphanumeric characters. Unsupported characters are replaced with an underscore (`_`).
* You cannot reassign a node layer using the Anypoint Visualizer UI if you assign it using application property file.

== Set a Layer with the Anypoint Visualizer UI

You can set the layer at deployment time using the Anypoint Visualizer UI or Runtime Manager API. By default, when you view an environment using Anypoint Visualizer, none of the nodes in the application are assigned to a layer. You can assign a node to an existing layer. The following procedures are also applicable for changing the layer of a node.

. Select the application node to add to a layer. +
You can hold the shift key to select multiple nodes to apply layers to all the selected nodes at once. +
+
_Result_: The *Customization* panel for the node appears in the right side of the panel as shown in the following image:
+
image::select-node.png[Select Node]

. In the *Customization* panel, expand the drop-down list next to *Layer* as shown in the following image:
+
image::select-layer.png[Select Layer]

. Select the layer you want from the drop-down list.

_Result_: The node you selected appears within the layer as shown in the following image:

== Create a New Layer

In addition to the default layers provided by Anypoint Visualizer, you can create new layers to customize the view of your application network.

. Select the node to add to a new layer.
. From the drop-down list in the *Customization* panel, select *New Layer*.
. Enter a name for your layer in the dialog box, then click *Create Layer*. +

_Result_: The node appears in the new layer. You can add additional nodes to the new layer as necessary.


== Delete a Layer

If a layer has no services assigned to it, Anypoint Visualizer deletes the layer automatically:

* If the layer is a default layer, it disappears from the canvas but is still available in the dropdown.
* If the layer is a custom layer, it disappears from the canvas and the dropdown.

Anypoint Visualizer also automatically adjusts the network display.

== Reorder Layers
You can reorder the layers from Anypoint Visualizer:

. In the Visualizer display, click inside the layer. Do not click a node within the layer.
. Use the arrows in the *System* panel to move the layer up or down relative to the other layers.
