= Use Layers in Anypoint Visualizer
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]

When you associate a node with a layer, you create a visual representation of the applications in your network.
Use one of the default layers provided by Anypoint Visualizer, or create a custom layer.

[NOTE]
The application appears in its assigned layer in every defined view in which it is included. It also appears in the correct layer across all visualization types.

== Add a Service to a Layer

Map a node to a layer in the application's properties file, or using the UI in the Architecture Visualization.

=== Set a Layer with Properties

To automate the classification of nodes into layers, configure the property `anypoint.platform.visualizer.layer=<name>` in the application's properties file. Note that this is an application property, not a server property.

When you use this property, nodes automatically appear in the specified layer. If the layer doesn't exist, it is created.

[NOTE]
You cannot reassign a node layer using the Anypoint Visualizer UI if you assign it using application property file.


== Set a Layer with the Architecture Visualization UI

If a node was not assigned to a layer at deployment time using the Runtime Manager UI or API, by default, the node is not assigned to a layer in Anypoint Visualizer. Use the Anypoint Visualizer UI to:

* Assign a node to an existing layer or, if the node does not have a layer set via properties, change the assigned layer.
* Create a new layer.

=== Assign a Layer to a Node

. Within the Architecture Visualization, select the application node to add to a layer. +
You can hold the shift key to select multiple nodes to apply layers to all the selected nodes at once. +
+
_Result_: The *Customization* section for the node appears in the *Customization* tab of the node's card as shown in the following image:
+

. In the *Customization* section, expand the drop-down list next to *Layer* as shown in the following image:
+
image::select-layer.png[Select Layer]

. Select the layer you want from the drop-down list.

_Result_: The node you selected appears within the layer as shown in the following image:

=== Create a New Layer

In addition to the default layers provided by Anypoint Visualizer, you can create new layers to customize the view of your application network.

. Select the node to add to a new layer.
. From the drop-down list in the *Customization* section, select *New Layer*.
. Enter a name for your layer in the dialog box, then click *Create Layer*. +

_Result_: The node appears in the new layer. You can add additional nodes to the new layer as necessary.

== Delete a Layer

If a layer has no services assigned to it, Anypoint Visualizer deletes the layer automatically:

* If the layer is a default layer, it disappears from the canvas but is still available in the dropdown.
* If the layer is a custom layer, it disappears from the canvas and the dropdown.

Anypoint Visualizer also automatically adjusts the network display.

== Reorder Layers

In the canvas of the Architecture Visualization, use the arrows on the right side of the layer to move it up or down relative to the other layers.
