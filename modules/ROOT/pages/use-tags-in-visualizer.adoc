= Use Tags in Anypoint Visualizer

You can add tags to an API, application, proxy, or other service. Similar to layers, there are two ways of assigning a tag to a node--by using properties, or through the Runtime Manager UI.

[NOTE]
If a tag is assigned to an application, the application will appear in every view in which the tags are selected.

== Setting the Tag Through Properties

To automate adding tag(s) to a node, use the property `anypoint.platform.visualizer.tags=<name>, <name>` in the application's properties file, or at deployment time through the Runtime Manager UI or API.
Note that this is an application property, not a server property.

When this property is used, the nodes automatically show the assigned tag(s) in the *View* card of Visualizer. The tag cannot be overridden in the UI and can only be modified in properties. You can still add other tags to this node using the UI, however. All tags are displayed as lowercase.

In the following example, the tag `project-b` was added through properties and therefore cannot be modified on the canvas.

== Setting the Tag Through the UI

By default, when you first view a node using Anypoint Visualizer, it does not have any tags assigned. You can assign a tag to an existing node using the UI if it does not already have the same tag applied through properties.

. Select the application node to tag. +
You can hold the shift key to select multiple nodes to apply tags to all the selected nodes at once. +
_Result:_ The *Customization* section for the node appears in the *Details* tab of the node's card as shown in the following image:
+

. In the *Customization* section, click *+ Add tag* as shown in the following image:

. Type the name of the tag to apply. Existing tags appear in a drop-down list as you begin to type. +
You can either: +
* Select an existing tag, or
* Enter a name for a new tag, and click *Create tag <your-tag>*, or
* Enter a name for the new tag, and press enter. +
[NOTE]
You cannot apply the same tag multiple times to a node. All tags are converted to lowercase and cannot have spaces.
+

+
_Result:_ The tags that you added to a node are listed in the *Customization* section. This node is included in the list of services if you xref:view.adoc#customize-view[filter by this tag].

== Delete a Tag

You can delete tags from Anypoint Visualizer. Deleting a tag does not delete the associated nodes.

To delete a tag assigned using the `anypoint.platform.visualizer.tags=<name>` property, return to the applicationâ€™s properties file and delete the assignment `anypoint.platform.visualizer.tags=<name>`.

To delete a tag that was configured in the UI:

. Select a node with the tag you wish to delete.
. Locate the tag in the *Customization* section, and click the *X* on the tag to delete.
