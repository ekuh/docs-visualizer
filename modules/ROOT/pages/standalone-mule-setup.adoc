== Verify Supported Standalone Mule Versions

Anypoint Visualizer supports the following Mule versions for standalone Mule deployments:

* Mule 3.8.7
* Mule 3.9.1+
* Mule 4.1.x
* Mule 4.2.x

== Install Agent

To support Anypoint Visualizer for standalone Mule deployments, install the xref:monitoring::am-installing.adoc[Anypoint Monitoring agent].
Anypoint Visualizer requires an additional header injection for standalone Mule deployments so that the deployments display the correct connections.
Due to a potential performance impact, however, the header injection is disabled by default for Mule 4 apps. 

== Enable Header Injection

For a standalone Mule deployment, you must enable header injection at the server (not app) level.
This affects all applications running on the server.

. To enable header injection for apps deployed to a standalone Mule instance, click *Server* in the menu on the left of *Runtime Manager*.
. Select the server for which to enable header injection and click *Manage Server*.
. Click the Properties tab and set the following property in the server:
`anypoint.platform.config.analytics.agent.header_injection.disabled=false`
You must set the property to `false`, as shown in the example to enable header injection, because the property is disabled by default.

=== Manage Performance and Data Collection

The agent that Anypoint Visualizer uses to collect metadata sometimes has a performance impact.

For more information about data collection and performance, see xref:visualizer::technical.adoc[Manage Performance and Data Collection].
