Views enable Visualizer editors to create and share views across environments with team members. Visualizer viewers each have their own private view that is dynamically updated with views that are shared with them to display the apps and views they have access to. 


== Private View

When you access Visualizer the first time, your private view is displayed. Each subsequent time you access Visualizer, you are returned to the view you last accessed and saved. Your private view provides a source of truth, where you can see a complete picture of the things you are working on.

Views that you have access to appear in a list in the top navigation bar on the right of the view name (click *V* to see the list). This gives you easy access to all the views that are shared with you, which saves you time because you don't need to readjust your filters every time to get the view you need. 

In your private view, you can:

* Edit and save your private view
* Rename your private view
* Discard changes you made to your private view
* Export your private view as a PNG file

You can't delete or share a private view. 

You can modify public (shared) views to display information you are interested in, but you can't save the changes you make. 

== Shared Views

As a Visualizer editor, you can create and share views to provide a consistent, high quality source of truth to your team members. Any user who has permission for the environment can see shared views, but only editors can create, rename, and edit public views. 

You can share views to share the app network graph with team members so they can use it to plan work, study the architecture of the app network, and troubleshoot more easily.

== Create a View

Only users with the *Visualizer Editor* permission can create views. 

. In the top navigation bar, on the right of the view name, click *V*.
. Click *+New*. 
. In the New view dialog, enter a *Name* for the view, and click *Save*. +
An asterisk ( * ) appears next to the view name until you click *Save* in the view designer.

. Select the environment and business group for the view. 
+

. Configure the view by using xref:use-tags-in-visualizer.adoc[tags] and services filters. 
. Click *Save*. +
Once you save the view, it becomes public, meaning that any user who has access to the apps in the environment sees the view in their private view view list. 


== Edit a View

Users can make changes to their private views, and save them, however, only users with the *Visualizer Editor* permission can edit public views. The steps are the same in either case. 

. Make your changes to the Visualizer canvas. 
. Click *Save*. 
. (Visual editor only) Click *Save as* to save the updated view as a new view while retaining the original view.
