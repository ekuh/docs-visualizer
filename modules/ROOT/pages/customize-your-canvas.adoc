= Customize the Canvas

You can choose what appears in your Visualizer canvas by applying filters for environments, tags, and services.
This enables you to hide the nodes that you do not want to see in the application graph.
Filters have a cascading design, so all nodes that don't belong to the checked environments or tags are automatically hidden from the list of services.

You can toggle *Show dependents and dependencies* to see the services and dependencies of the nodes and services which have the selected tags.
The *View* card and the canvas are updated to display the current selection.

Visualizer editors can save defined views so that any Visualizer user can access them.
When you close Anypoint Visualizer and reload the canvas later, the views you last accessed are displayed.

You can customize layers, tags, and display names in the Visualizer UI or by setting a runtime property. If you are using a Mule runtime patch that was released after December 12, 2019, you can use all unicode characters with UTF-8 encoding (such as international letters, symbols, and numbers).

== Layers

You can use one of the default layers provided by Anypoint Visualizer, or add a custom layer to create a visual representation of the apps in your network. You can use layers across Anypoint Visualizer, but note that you can only define layers in the xref:architecture-visualization.adoc[Architecture Visualization].

To automate the classification of nodes into layers, configure the property `anypoint.platform.visualizer.layer=<name>`.

For more information, see xref:layers.adoc[Use Layers in Anypoint Visualizer].

== Tags

You can add tags to API, application, proxy, or other services, so you can use the tags as filters to adjust your view. You can use tags across Anypoint Visualizer, but note that you can only define tags in the xref:architecture-visualization.adoc[Architecture Visualization].

To automate adding tag(s) to a node, use the property `anypoint.platform.visualizer.tags=<name>, <name>`.

For more information, see xref:use-tags-in-visualizer.adoc[Use Tags in Visualizer].

== Display Name

You can edit the display name of a service to provide a more readable, explanatory title. You can use display names across Anypoint Visualizer, but note that you can only define display names in the xref:architecture-visualization.adoc[Architecture Visualization].

To automate adding a display name to the node, configure the property `anypoint.platform.visualizer.displayName=<name>`.



= Use Layers in Anypoint Visualizer
ifndef::env-site,env-github[]
include::_attributes.adoc[]
endif::[]

When you associate a node with a layer, you create a visual representation of the applications in your network.
Use one of the default layers provided by Anypoint Visualizer, or create a custom layer.

[NOTE]
The application appears in its assigned layer in every defined view in which it is included. It also appears in the correct layer across all visualization types.

== Add a Service to a Layer

Map a node to a layer in the application's properties file, or using the UI in the Architecture Visualization.

=== Set a Layer with Properties

To automate the classification of nodes into layers, configure the property `anypoint.platform.visualizer.layer=<name>` in the application's properties file. Note that this is an application property, not a server property.

When you use this property, nodes automatically appear in the specified layer. If the layer doesn't exist, it is created.

[NOTE]
You cannot reassign a node layer using the Anypoint Visualizer UI if you assign it using application property file.


== Set a Layer with the Architecture Visualization UI

If a node was not assigned to a layer at deployment time using the Runtime Manager UI or API, by default, the node is not assigned to a layer in Anypoint Visualizer. Use the Anypoint Visualizer UI to:

* Assign a node to an existing layer or, if the node does not have a layer set via properties, change the assigned layer.
* Create a new layer.

=== Assign a Layer to a Node

. Within the Architecture Visualization, select the application node to add to a layer. +
You can hold the shift key to select multiple nodes to apply layers to all the selected nodes at once. +
+
_Result_: The *Customization* section for the node appears in the *Customization* tab of the node's card as shown in the following image:
+
image::select-node.png[Select Node]

. In the *Customization* section, expand the drop-down list next to *Layer* as shown in the following image:
+
image::select-layer.png[Select Layer]

. Select the layer you want from the drop-down list.

_Result_: The node you selected appears within the layer as shown in the following image:

image::select-layer-result.png[Node in Layer]

=== Create a New Layer

In addition to the default layers provided by Anypoint Visualizer, you can create new layers to customize the view of your application network.

. Select the node to add to a new layer.
. From the drop-down list in the *Customization* section, select *New Layer*.
. Enter a name for your layer in the dialog box, then click *Create Layer*. +

_Result_: The node appears in the new layer. You can add additional nodes to the new layer as necessary.

== Delete a Layer

If a layer has no services assigned to it, Anypoint Visualizer deletes the layer automatically:

* If the layer is a default layer, it disappears from the canvas but is still available in the dropdown.
* If the layer is a custom layer, it disappears from the canvas and the dropdown.

Anypoint Visualizer also automatically adjusts the network display.

== Reorder Layers

In the canvas of the Architecture Visualization, use the arrows on the right side of the layer to move it up or down relative to the other layers.
